                <div class="quote mission-quote">
                    <p>"being present in awareness brings to us the miracle of being alive, of emergence of our individual purpose, and consciousness of the eternal source"</p>
                </div>

                <p>I consider conscious awareness to be the miracle of humanity. It is simultaneously our greatest potential and, when realized, our greatest act of love and creativity. It serves as both the medium and the source of possible human experience â€“ without conscious awareness, we are like amoeba.</p>
                
                <p>Conscious awareness is what imbues our lives and experience with magic. It's the process that reveals the miracle of life in every moment. Through conscious awareness, we create the world we wish for. It is our greatest gift, that which is innate, and that which when employed, allows us to share in the miracle of our interdependent co-creative existence.</p>

                <div class="session-info">
                    <h3>My Approach</h3>
                    <p>Through activating and practicing conscious awareness we become the gift of our true selves and share this emanation of source with the rest of humanity. The quality of our conscious awareness defines our experience of ourselves, of others and the context of our existence. That quality is 'always already' sufficient to the now, always already endless in its potential and possibilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>This understanding draws from various wisdom traditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The fiery teachings of Kalachakra</li>
                        <li>The subtle oceans of Taoism</li>
                        <li>The loving awe of Sufism</li>
                        <li>The Christian mysteries</li>
                        <li>The Liberation in Buddhism</li>
                        <li>The wonder of Quantum understanding</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Values & Experience</h2>
                <p>Since 1997, I have served as a therapist, teacher, and facilitator. My work is grounded in personal and spiritual foundations, pursuing the dream of a better world through various channels:</p>
                
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>Facilitating personal development</li>
                    <li>Supporting organizational growth</li>
                    <li>Engaging in social activism</li>
                    <li>Promoting environmental awareness</li>
                    <li>Teaching process awareness</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The themes of consciousness, nature, and relationships guide these engagements. I teach integral perspectives on consciousness, ecosystems, and society, exploring psychological ecosystems, meaning, and success in learning and work.</p>

                <h2>MY STORY, ABBRIDGED</h2>
                <p>â€¦the degree to which each of us can stand in our light and confront our darknessâ€¦</p>

I spent the first thirty years of my life in South Africa, growing up during the darkest years of apartheid, and reveling during the years of emerging light of democratic process. This context provided me with a unique opportunity for personal development. I grew up in a bilingual, bi-religious, bi-political home. I attended schools imbued with the ideologies of separation, privilege and hierarchy. The social environment was fiercely controlled by a police state maintaining and nurturing a psychology of threat, fear and war. I was surrounded by hatred, suspicion, prejudice and violence.

It was in this context I would discover love, inclusion and acceptance as a state of inner being, a wellspring of peace. It was in this hotbed of trauma and injustice that my desire to change the world found fertile ground to develop and mature. It was in confronting the reality that all people are capable of the highest AND the most dire acts that I awakened to the fact that real change â€“ the world I wished for and knew was possible â€“ would not come from laws and systems, but from within.
 
                <p></p>I came to understand that the degree to which each of us can stand in our light and confront our darkness is what defines the quality of our personal and collective experience. And if I wanted a better world, well, it was just a matter of setting about making it.</p>
